						<h3>About Me</h3>
			
						<img id="profile" src="assets/images/profile_pic.png" alt="pic of me">
						<p>Born and raised in IL, I grew up with all the blessings that Chicago had to offer. I grew up eating deep-dish pizza, Italian beef, and hot dogs with the works. Along with my infatuation with food, I've always had a passion for helping others and understanding how something works. After going to school to puruse pharmacy and realizing that it fulfilled niether, I started looking for a new path for myself. </p>
						<p>With my desire to solve problems and understand the world around me, computer science seemed like a perfect fit. To build up  knowledge on the expansive field of IT, I took a Full-Stack development course which allowed me to work with technologies used by both  front-end and back-end developers. Empowered with this knowledge I now enjoy putting my newfound toys to work designing new apps and websites. </p>
						<p>When I'm not cooped up behind a computer screen I enjoy working out, good stories, and deciding on the next place to eat at. So if there's ever a question of where I'm at just follow the cookie crumbs and you'll be sure to find me. </p>
