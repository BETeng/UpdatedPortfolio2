      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img id="profile" src="assets/images/profile_pic.png" alt="pic of me">
      <p>I was born on October 9th 1995 in Illinois where I spent my entire life until now. I once had aspirations to become a pharmacist, but upon working in a pharmacy, decided that it was not the path I could see myself living. Upon leaving the pharmacy I put thought into my future and decided upon a life helping people from behind the screen.</p>
        <p>I enjoys video games, good stories, and food. In my free time I like to try and recreate recipes and try new foods from different cultures. A moment that I am both proud and slightly concerned with is when I ate 12 tacos at a friends graduation party and was wondering what was for dessert. </p>
      <p>If you don't find me in bed, you can find me raiding the fridge or finding my next victim on yelp or grubhub.  </p>
